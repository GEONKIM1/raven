    abstract = {The Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) Facility at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) started testing new fuels and reactor technologies once again in 2018 and new experiments and tests are currently being designed like for example the water loop “TREAT Water Environment Recirculating Loop” (TWERL). During the design of such experiments, the designer must assess how close the experiment reproduces the physics (and other important phenomena) happening during a transient of interest compared to the full-size reactor the experiment attempts representing. Traditionally, to assess this “representativity” of the experiment, scaling theory involving expert judgment is needed. This paper presents a step towards a systematic modeling and simulation (M\\&amp;S) informed methodology for experiment design. The new methodology compares a model of the full system and a model of the mock-up facility that are subject to the same perturbations. In this way, the “overlap” of the perturbed experiment and full-size facility model outputs can be analyzed and the “representativity” of the experiment determined. The paper presents a RELAP5-3D analysis, where TWERL LOCA calculations are compared to prototypic PWR LOCA calculations with respect to representativity. To inform the design of the TWERL experiments, i.e. to find the most “representative” configuration for the TWERL loop, different design parameters for TWERL have been optimized in the study.},

abstract = {This paper presents a global approach to the validation of the parameters that enter into the neutronics simulation tools for advanced fast reactors with the objective to reduce the uncertainties associated to crucial design parameters. This global approach makes use of sensitivity/uncertainty methods; statistical data adjustments; integral experiment selection, analysis and “representativity” quantification with respect to a reference system; scientifically based cross-section covariance data and appropriate methods for their use in multigroup calculations. This global approach has been applied to the uncertainty reduction on the criticality of the Advanced Burner Reactor (both metal and oxide core versions) presently investigated in the frame of the GNEP initiative. The results obtained are very encouraging and allow to indicate some possible improvements of the ENDF/B-VII data file.}

The present paper gives a summary of the development of more and more sophisticated validation strategies up to the present trend for science-based validation approaches. Most examples and some very recent original developments are given, mostly in the field of neutronics that has traditionally provided cutting edge advances for simulation tools validation.}
